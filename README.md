# What is this project about

Here you can find my results for performance testing of the Redis BloomFilter and the load tests themself. To get the info about BloomFilter, please visit https://oss.redis.com/redisbloom/

# Performance testing results



## Getting Started

You can perform the load testing by yourself using tests from this repository. About how to run them locally you will learn from the sections below.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install

```
1. .Net 5.0 SDK - use the official Microsoft website.
2. Docker Desktop (any version) - use the official Docker website.
```

### Build and run

Firstly, clone the repository to any folder you wish:

```
git clone https://github.com/Expeth/redis-bloom-performance.git
```

Then, adjust appsettings.json file with the needed configuration of the BloomFilter:

```
"bloom": {
    "name": "test",        // The key under which the filter is found
    "errorRate": "0.0001", // The desired probability for false positives. The rate is a decimal value between 0 and 1.
    "capacity": "10000000" // The number of entries intended to be added to the filter. 
}
```

Then, simply build and run the needed tests from Rider or VisualStudio. The results you can check in the test output or in the "reports" folder, generated by NBomber.
